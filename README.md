##  This is logging excercise file.

##  Created .py files in "Visual Studio Code" and used conda base environment.
 
##  Used three methods with simple example for logging messages: BasicCongig, Logger, Logging.config.

##  I have used simple nested if statement in the program just to log messages based on certain condition and understand how logging works.
